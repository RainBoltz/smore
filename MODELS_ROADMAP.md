# Modern Graph Embedding Models - Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines modern knowledge graph and network embedding models that could be excellent additions to the SMORe-Go framework.

## Priority 1: High-Value, Implementation-Ready Models

### 1. Node2Vec ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: Industry Standard
**Complexity**: Medium
**Performance**: Excellent

**Why implement it:**
- Extension of DeepWalk with biased random walks
- Balances BFS and DFS exploration via p and q parameters

- Fits perfectly with existing SMORe architecture

**Implementation Details:**
- Reuse existing random walk infrastructure
- Add biased sampling based on return (p) and in-out (q) parameters
- Minimal changes to optimizer (same skip-gram approach)

**Key Parameters:**
```go
type Node2Vec struct {
    p float64  // Return parameter (controls likelihood to return to previous node)
    q float64  // In-out parameter (BFS vs DFS: q > 1 = BFS, q < 1 = DFS)
}
```

        score += diff * diff
    }
    return math.Sqrt(score)
}
```

    result := make(ComplexVector, len(h))
    for i := range h {
        result[i] = h[i] * r[i]
    }
    return distance(result, t)
